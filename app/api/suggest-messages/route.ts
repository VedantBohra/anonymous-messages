Each suggestion should be separated by "||". These suggestions are for an anonymous social messaging 
platform like Qooh.me and should be suitable for a diverse audience. Avoid personal or sensitive topics, 
focusing instead on universal themes that encourage friendly interactions.

Base your suggestions on the following message history: ${message?.length > 0 ? JSON.stringify(message) : '[No messages provided]'}

If No messages provided then just use something similar to the following Example output.
Example output: 
"What's a hobby you have recently started?"||"If you could have dinner with any historical figure, who would it be?"||"Whatâ€™s something new you learned recently?"

Ensure the suggestions are intriguing, foster curiosity, and contribute to a positive, friendly environment.`;
